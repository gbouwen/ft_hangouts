# ft_hangouts
A small contact management application written in Kotlin. <br />
This was made as part of the Technical Interview Simulations organized by Codam. <br />
I made this in three days without any prior knowledge of Android Studio and Kotlin.  <br />

To run the project, open the ft_hangouts_project directory in android studio. <br />
Create a Virtual Device in the AVD Manager, make sure to have enough space on your device. <br />
(You can also connect your own Android device if you have one). <br />
Pick the Emulator or your own device from the list of available devices and then press 'Run'. <br />

New contacts get added to a SQLite database. The contact list on the main screen shows all the contacts.  <br />
Clicking on a contact will let you edit their details, delete them from the list, or send them a message. <br />
The message will be sent as a SMS. <br />

After clicking the add button, you will be taken to this screen to add a new contact <br />
